The Social Links plugin adds a widget and shortcode to your WordPress website allowing you to display icons linking to your social profiles.

== Description ==
The Social Links plugin adds a widget and shortcode to your WordPress website allowing you to display icons linking to your social profiles. The new version includes the following social networks:

* Google+
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Linkedin
* YouTube
* Instagram
* Pintrest

We've also added support for a **shortcode** (`[the-social-links]`) for use in WordPress posts and pages and a **custom template tag** (`<?php the_social_links();?>`) for use in template files.

**The Social Links is translation ready!**

It's important to note that we will only support the above social networks in the free version. Want extra social networks? You can purchase [The Social Links Pack](https://digitalleap.co.za/wordpress/plugins/social-links/the-social-links-pack/) for only $5 (unlimited commercial use) which gives you access to:

**The reason we charge for support and extra social networks is to make sure we maintain a high level of support on this plugin. Our developers need to get paid even though they love contributing towards the community.**


== Installation ==

Installation via WordPress Dashboard:

1. Navigate to Plugins->Add New
1. Search for "The Social Links" and click "Install Now"
1. Click “Settings” or browse to the "The Social Links" once you have installed the plugin to configure your social network links.
1. Go to your widgets and add the "The Social Links" widget to your sidebar, add the shortcode (`[the-social-links]`) in your posts and pages or add the custom template tag (`<?php the_social_links();?><?php the_social_links();?>`) in your template files.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add the bookmarks to my theme manually (also for themes that do not support widgets)? =

Using the shortcode (`[the-social-links]`) in your posts and pages or by adding the custom template tag (`<?php the_social_links();?>`) in your template files.

= Are you going to add other social networks? =

To keep the plugin as fluid as possible we have decided to minimise the amount of networks in the free version. If you have a network that you think should be added, please head to our [support page](http://digitalleap.co.za/wordpress/plugin/the-social-links/) to submit a request.

= Can I use other icons? =

We have decided that to keep a high standard for the plugin we will be using font based icons. All icons are styled by CSS. We are developing additional premium icon packs that you will be able to purchase.

= Can I change the order of the icons? =

You can change the order on your settings page.
